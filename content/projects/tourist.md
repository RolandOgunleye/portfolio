## Intro
The Tourist Agency Booking System Database Management System is designed to
efficiently manage and facilitate tourist operations such as storing tourist information, booking
trips for travelers, and focusing on attractive tourism points. This system aims to provide a
user-friendly interface for customers to explore various tourist trips, check the availability of
flights, and add required payments for flights and other tourist operations.

## Description
Engineered a Tourist Booking system from scratch, combining a ** React Frontend with Material UI ** and a
**Golang Backend API** integrated with an **Oracle relational database**. Hosted the database on **AWS RDS and EC2**
ensuring scalability and **99.99% uptime guarantee**, establishing database is highly available and reliable.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and iterate on project deliverables. Achieved a
perfect assignment final grade with an **additional 25% bonus mark**.

## Final Thoughts and Challenges
Throughout this project, I've encountered various challenges that have broadened my
understanding of application development. From structuring an efficient database for a tourist
booking system to designing an attractive graphical interface and ensuring accurate data
retrieval through backend queries, each task brought its own set of insights. Notably, the process
of seamlessly integrating backend data with the front end posed a particularly interesting
challenge. Making sure the information not only gets retrieved accurately but also looks good on
the user interface requires a thoughtful approach. This project has served as a comprehensive
learning experience, guiding me through the intricacies of creating an application from scratch.
Working with a normalized database has underscored the importance of data organization.
