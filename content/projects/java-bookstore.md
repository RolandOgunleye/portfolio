## Description
Worked with a team of three to design and develop a **JavaFX-based bookstore application using Java and FXML**.
Communication and teamwork skills were utilized throughout the entirety of the project to complete the
application. Implemented **Java FXML** as a team to create an intuitive user interface for a bookstore application, enabling
seamless navigation and interaction with the storeâ€™s inventory and customer account management features. 


## OOP Concepts

We designed a **state design diagram** to model dynamic behavior, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the application's states and transitions. Additionally, a detailed **use case diagram** captured various interactions between users and the system. These **OOP concepts**, coupled with other principles, fortified the foundation of our project, enabling us to create an efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly bookstore application. The successful integration of these diagrams showcased our commitment to leveraging sound object-oriented design throughout the development process.

## JavaFXML
 Furthermore, the project's graphical user interface was developed seamlessly using **JavaFXML**. This technology played a pivotal role in enhancing the visual aspects of the application, providing an intuitive and dynamic user experience.

## Final Thoughts and Results
Leveraged object-oriented design principles to develop a maintainable JavaFX-based bookstore application and then verbally presented the project to TA to achieve a **final assignment grade of 100%**.
