## Description

Implemented a Student Management System using a **mySQL database, C++, and Visual Studio**. Designed the system to efficiently manage student personal information, courses, and student status. Utilized Visual Studioâ€™s Windows Form application to create a user-friendly interface through components such as buttons, labels, text boxes, and data grids for information control and display.
